      "TO SHERLOCK HOLMES SHE IS ALWAYS THE WOMAN. I HAVE SELDOM HEARD HIM MENTION HER UNDER ANY OTHER NAME. IN HIS EYES SHE ECLIPSES AND PREDOMINATES THE WHOLE OF HER SEX. IT WAS NOT THAT HE FELT ANY EMOTION AKIN TO LOVE FOR IRENE ADLER. ALL EMOTIONS, AND THAT ONE PARTICULARLY, WERE ABHORRENT TO HIS COLD, PRECISE BUT ADMIRABLY BALANCED MIND. HE WAS, I TAKE IT, THE MOST PERFECT REASONING AND OBSERVING MACHINE THAT THE WORLD HAS SEEN, BUT AS A LOVER HE WOULD HAVE PLACED HIMSELF IN A FALSE POSITION. HE NEVER SPOKE OF THE SOFTER PASSIONS, SAVE WITH A GIBE AND A SNEER. THEY WERE ADMIRABLE THINGS FOR THE OBSERVER--EXCELLENT FOR DRAWING THE VEIL FROM MEN'S MOTIVES AND ACTIONS. BUT FOR THE TRAINED REASONER TO ADMIT SUCH INTRUSIONS INTO HIS OWN DELICATE AND FINELY ADJUSTED TEMPERAMENT WAS TO INTRODUCE A DISTRACTING FACTOR WHICH MIGHT THROW A DOUBT UPON ALL HIS MENTAL RESULTS. GRIT IN A SENSITIVE INSTRUMENT, OR A CRACK IN ONE OF HIS OWN HIGH-POWER LENSES, WOULD NOT BE MORE DISTURBING THAN A STRONG EMOTION IN A NATURE SUCH AS HIS. AND YET THERE WAS BUT ONE WOMAN TO HIM, AND THAT WOMAN WAS THE LATE IRENE ADLER, OF DUBIOUS AND QUESTIONABLE MEMORY.\n",
      "IT WAS A QUARTER PAST SIX WHEN WE LEFT BAKER STREET, AND IT STILL WANTED TEN MINUTES TO THE HOUR WHEN WE FOUND OURSELVES IN SERPENTINE AVENUE. IT WAS ALREADY DUSK, AND THE LAMPS WERE JUST BEING LIGHTED AS WE PACED UP AND DOWN IN FRONT OF BRIONY LODGE, WAITING FOR THE COMING OF ITS OCCUPANT. THE HOUSE WAS JUST SUCH AS I HAD PICTURED IT FROM SHERLOCK HOLMES' SUCCINCT DESCRIPTION, BUT THE LOCALITY APPEARED TO BE LESS PRIVATE THAN I EXPECTED. ON THE CONTRARY, FOR A SMALL STREET IN A QUIET NEIGHBOURHOOD, IT WAS REMARKABLY ANIMATED. THERE WAS A GROUP OF SHABBILY DRESSED MEN SMOKING AND LAUGHING IN A CORNER, A SCISSORS-GRINDER WITH HIS WHEEL, TWO GUARDSMEN WHO WERE FLIRTING WITH A NURSE-GIRL, AND SEVERAL WELL-DRESSED YOUNG MEN WHO WERE LOUNGING UP AND DOWN WITH CIGARS IN THEIR MOUTHS.\n",
      "\"GOOD-NIGHT, MISTER SHERLOCK HOLMES.\"\n",
      "\"YOU HAVE REALLY GOT IT!\" HE CRIED, GRASPING SHERLOCK HOLMES BY EITHER SHOULDER AND LOOKING EAGERLY INTO HIS FACE.\n",
      "\"MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES, I BELIEVE?\" SAID SHE.\n",
      "\"WHAT!\" SHERLOCK HOLMES STAGGERED BACK, WHITE WITH CHAGRIN AND SURPRISE. \"DO YOU MEAN THAT SHE HAS LEFT ENGLAND?\"\n",
      "\"WE SHALL SEE.\" HE PUSHED PAST THE SERVANT AND RUSHED INTO THE DRAWING-ROOM, FOLLOWED BY THE KING AND MYSELF. THE FURNITURE WAS SCATTERED ABOUT IN EVERY DIRECTION, WITH DISMANTLED SHELVES AND OPEN DRAWERS, AS IF THE LADY HAD HURRIEDLY RANSACKED THEM BEFORE HER FLIGHT. HOLMES RUSHED AT THE BELL-PULL, TORE BACK A SMALL SLIDING SHUTTER, AND, PLUNGING IN HIS HAND, PULLED OUT A PHOTOGRAPH AND A LETTER. THE PHOTOGRAPH WAS OF IRENE ADLER HERSELF IN EVENING DRESS, THE LETTER WAS SUPERSCRIBED TO \"SHERLOCK HOLMES, ESQ. TO BE LEFT TILL CALLED FOR.\" MY FRIEND TORE IT OPEN, AND WE ALL THREE READ IT TOGETHER. IT WAS DATED AT MIDNIGHT OF THE PRECEDING NIGHT AND RAN IN THIS WAY:\n",
      "\"MY DEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES,--YOU REALLY DID IT VERY WELL. YOU TOOK ME IN COMPLETELY. UNTIL AFTER THE ALARM OF FIRE, I HAD NOT A SUSPICION. BUT THEN, WHEN I FOUND HOW I HAD BETRAYED MYSELF, I BEGAN TO THINK. I HAD BEEN WARNED AGAINST YOU MONTHS AGO. I HAD BEEN TOLD THAT, IF THE KING EMPLOYED AN AGENT, IT WOULD CERTAINLY BE YOU. AND YOUR ADDRESS HAD BEEN GIVEN ME. YET, WITH ALL THIS, YOU MADE ME REVEAL WHAT YOU WANTED TO KNOW. EVEN AFTER I BECAME SUSPICIOUS, I FOUND IT HARD TO THINK EVIL OF SUCH A DEAR, KIND OLD CLERGYMAN. BUT, YOU KNOW, I HAVE BEEN TRAINED AS AN ACTRESS MYSELF. MALE COSTUME IS NOTHING NEW TO ME. I OFTEN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE FREEDOM WHICH IT GIVES. I SENT JOHN, THE COACHMAN, TO WATCH YOU, RAN UPSTAIRS, GOT INTO MY WALKING CLOTHES, AS I CALL THEM, AND CAME DOWN JUST AS YOU DEPARTED.\n",
      "\"WELL, I FOLLOWED YOU TO YOUR DOOR, AND SO MADE SURE THAT I WAS REALLY AN OBJECT OF INTEREST TO THE CELEBRATED MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES. THEN I, RATHER IMPRUDENTLY, WISHED YOU GOOD-NIGHT, AND STARTED FOR THE TEMPLE TO SEE MY HUSBAND.\n",
      "\"WE BOTH THOUGHT THE BEST RESOURCE WAS FLIGHT, WHEN PURSUED BY SO FORMIDABLE AN ANTAGONIST; SO YOU WILL FIND THE NEST EMPTY WHEN YOU CALL TO-MORROW. AS TO THE PHOTOGRAPH, YOUR CLIENT MAY REST IN PEACE. I LOVE AND AM LOVED BY A BETTER MAN THAN HE. THE KING MAY DO WHAT HE WILL WITHOUT HINDRANCE FROM ONE WHOM HE HAS CRUELLY WRONGED. I KEEP IT ONLY TO SAFEGUARD MYSELF, AND TO PRESERVE A WEAPON WHICH WILL ALWAYS SECURE ME FROM ANY STEPS WHICH HE MIGHT TAKE IN THE FUTURE. I LEAVE A PHOTOGRAPH WHICH HE MIGHT CARE TO POSSESS; AND I REMAIN, DEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES,\n",
      "AND THAT WAS HOW A GREAT SCANDAL THREATENED TO AFFECT THE KINGDOM OF BOHEMIA, AND HOW THE BEST PLANS OF MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES WERE BEATEN BY A WOMAN'S WIT. HE USED TO MAKE MERRY OVER THE CLEVERNESS OF WOMEN, BUT I HAVE NOT HEARD HIM DO IT OF LATE. AND WHEN HE SPEAKS OF IRENE ADLER, OR WHEN HE REFERS TO HER PHOTOGRAPH, IT IS ALWAYS UNDER THE HONOURABLE TITLE OF THE WOMAN.\n",
      "I HAD CALLED UPON MY FRIEND, MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES, ONE DAY IN THE AUTUMN OF LAST YEAR AND FOUND HIM IN DEEP CONVERSATION WITH A VERY STOUT, FLORID-FACED, ELDERLY GENTLEMAN WITH FIERY RED HAIR. WITH AN APOLOGY FOR MY INTRUSION, I WAS ABOUT TO WITHDRAW WHEN HOLMES PULLED ME ABRUPTLY INTO THE ROOM AND CLOSED THE DOOR BEHIND ME.\n",
      "SHERLOCK HOLMES' QUICK EYE TOOK IN MY OCCUPATION, AND HE SHOOK HIS HEAD WITH A SMILE AS HE NOTICED MY QUESTIONING GLANCES. \"BEYOND THE OBVIOUS FACTS THAT HE HAS AT SOME TIME DONE MANUAL LABOUR, THAT HE TAKES SNUFF, THAT HE IS A FREEMASON, THAT HE HAS BEEN IN CHINA, AND THAT HE HAS DONE A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF WRITING LATELY, I CAN DEDUCE NOTHING ELSE.\"\n",
      "\"WELL, IT IS JUST AS I HAVE BEEN TELLING YOU, MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES,\" SAID JABEZ WILSON, MOPPING HIS FOREHEAD; \"I HAVE A SMALL PAWNBROKER'S BUSINESS AT COBURG SQUARE, NEAR THE CITY. IT'S NOT A VERY LARGE AFFAIR, AND OF LATE YEARS IT HAS NOT DONE MORE THAN JUST GIVE ME A LIVING. I USED TO BE ABLE TO KEEP TWO ASSISTANTS, BUT NOW I ONLY KEEP ONE; AND I WOULD HAVE A JOB TO PAY HIM BUT THAT HE IS WILLING TO COME FOR HALF WAGES SO AS TO LEARN THE BUSINESS.\"\n",
      "\"WHAT IS THE NAME OF THIS OBLIGING YOUTH?\" ASKED SHERLOCK HOLMES.\n",
      "SHERLOCK HOLMES AND I SURVEYED THIS CURT ANNOUNCEMENT AND THE RUEFUL FACE BEHIND IT, UNTIL THE COMICAL SIDE OF THE AFFAIR SO COMPLETELY OVERTOPPED EVERY OTHER CONSIDERATION THAT WE BOTH BURST OUT INTO A ROAR OF LAUGHTER.\n",
      "WE TRAVELLED BY THE UNDERGROUND AS FAR AS ALDERSGATE; AND A SHORT WALK TOOK US TO SAXE-COBURG SQUARE, THE SCENE OF THE SINGULAR STORY WHICH WE HAD LISTENED TO IN THE MORNING. IT WAS A POKY, LITTLE, SHABBY-GENTEEL PLACE, WHERE FOUR LINES OF DINGY TWO-STORIED BRICK HOUSES LOOKED OUT INTO A SMALL RAILED-IN ENCLOSURE, WHERE A LAWN OF WEEDY GRASS AND A FEW CLUMPS OF FADED LAUREL BUSHES MADE A HARD FIGHT AGAINST A SMOKE-LADEN AND UNCONGENIAL ATMOSPHERE. THREE GILT BALLS AND A BROWN BOARD WITH \"JABEZ WILSON\" IN WHITE LETTERS, UPON A CORNER HOUSE, ANNOUNCED THE PLACE WHERE OUR RED-HEADED CLIENT CARRIED ON HIS BUSINESS. SHERLOCK HOLMES STOPPED IN FRONT OF IT WITH HIS HEAD ON ONE SIDE AND LOOKED IT ALL OVER, WITH HIS EYES SHINING BRIGHTLY BETWEEN PUCKERED LIDS. THEN HE WALKED SLOWLY UP THE STREET, AND THEN DOWN AGAIN TO THE CORNER, STILL LOOKING KEENLY AT THE HOUSES. FINALLY HE RETURNED TO THE PAWNBROKER'S, AND, HAVING THUMPED VIGOROUSLY UPON THE PAVEMENT WITH HIS STICK TWO OR THREE TIMES, HE WENT UP TO THE DOOR AND KNOCKED. IT WAS INSTANTLY OPENED BY A BRIGHT-LOOKING, CLEAN-SHAVEN YOUNG FELLOW, WHO ASKED HIM TO STEP IN.\n",
      "I TRUST THAT I AM NOT MORE DENSE THAN MY NEIGHBOURS, BUT I WAS ALWAYS OPPRESSED WITH A SENSE OF MY OWN STUPIDITY IN MY DEALINGS WITH SHERLOCK HOLMES. HERE I HAD HEARD WHAT HE HAD HEARD, I HAD SEEN WHAT HE HAD SEEN, AND YET FROM HIS WORDS IT WAS EVIDENT THAT HE SAW CLEARLY NOT ONLY WHAT HAD HAPPENED BUT WHAT WAS ABOUT TO HAPPEN, WHILE TO ME THE WHOLE BUSINESS WAS STILL CONFUSED AND GROTESQUE. AS I DROVE HOME TO MY HOUSE IN KENSINGTON I THOUGHT OVER IT ALL, FROM THE EXTRAORDINARY STORY OF THE RED-HEADED COPIER OF THE ENCYCLOPAEDIA DOWN TO THE VISIT TO SAXE-COBURG SQUARE, AND THE OMINOUS WORDS WITH WHICH HE HAD PARTED FROM ME. WHAT WAS THIS NOCTURNAL EXPEDITION, AND WHY SHOULD I GO ARMED? WHERE WERE WE GOING, AND WHAT WERE WE TO DO? I HAD THE HINT FROM HOLMES THAT THIS SMOOTH-FACED PAWNBROKER'S ASSISTANT WAS A FORMIDABLE MAN--A MAN WHO MIGHT PLAY A DEEP GAME. I TRIED TO PUZZLE IT OUT, BUT GAVE IT UP IN DESPAIR AND SET THE MATTER ASIDE UNTIL NIGHT SHOULD BRING AN EXPLANATION.\n",
      "\"I THINK YOU WILL FIND,\" SAID SHERLOCK HOLMES, \"THAT YOU WILL PLAY FOR A HIGHER STAKE TO-NIGHT THAN YOU HAVE EVER DONE YET, AND THAT THE PLAY WILL BE MORE EXCITING. FOR YOU, MR. MERRYWEATHER, THE STAKE WILL BE SOME $30,000; AND FOR YOU, JONES, IT WILL BE THE MAN UPON WHOM YOU WISH TO LAY YOUR HANDS.\"\n",
      "SHERLOCK HOLMES WAS NOT VERY COMMUNICATIVE DURING THE LONG DRIVE AND LAY BACK IN THE CAB HUMMING THE TUNES WHICH HE HAD HEARD IN THE AFTERNOON. WE RATTLED THROUGH AN ENDLESS LABYRINTH OF GAS-LIT STREETS UNTIL WE EMERGED INTO FARRINGTON STREET.\n",
      "SHERLOCK HOLMES HAD SPRUNG OUT AND SEIZED THE INTRUDER BY THE COLLAR. THE OTHER DIVED DOWN THE HOLE, AND I HEARD THE SOUND OF RENDING CLOTH AS JONES CLUTCHED AT HIS SKIRTS. THE LIGHT FLASHED UPON THE BARREL OF A REVOLVER, BUT HOLMES' HUNTING CROP CAME DOWN ON THE MAN'S WRIST, AND THE PISTOL CLINKED UPON THE STONE FLOOR.\n",
      "\"MY DEAR FELLOW,\" SAID SHERLOCK HOLMES AS WE SAT ON EITHER SIDE OF THE FIRE IN HIS LODGINGS AT BAKER STREET, \"LIFE IS INFINITELY STRANGER THAN ANYTHING WHICH THE MIND OF MAN COULD INVENT. WE WOULD NOT DARE TO CONCEIVE THE THINGS WHICH ARE REALLY MERE COMMONPLACES OF EXISTENCE. IF WE COULD FLY OUT OF THAT WINDOW HAND IN HAND, HOVER OVER THIS GREAT CITY, GENTLY REMOVE THE ROOFS, AND PEEP IN AT THE QUEER THINGS WHICH ARE GOING ON, THE STRANGE COINCIDENCES, THE PLANNINGS, THE CROSS-PURPOSES, THE WONDERFUL CHAINS OF EVENTS, WORKING THROUGH GENERATIONS, AND LEADING TO THE MOST OUTRE RESULTS, IT WOULD MAKE ALL FICTION WITH ITS CONVENTIONALITIES AND FORESEEN CONCLUSIONS MOST STALE AND UNPROFITABLE.\"\n",
      "AS HE SPOKE THERE WAS A TAP AT THE DOOR, AND THE BOY IN BUTTONS ENTERED TO ANNOUNCE MISS MARY SUTHERLAND, WHILE THE LADY HERSELF LOOMED BEHIND HIS SMALL BLACK FIGURE LIKE A FULL-SAILED MERCHANT-MAN BEHIND A TINY PILOT BOAT. SHERLOCK HOLMES WELCOMED HER WITH THE EASY COURTESY FOR WHICH HE WAS REMARKABLE, AND, HAVING CLOSED THE DOOR AND BOWED HER INTO AN ARMCHAIR, HE LOOKED HER OVER IN THE MINUTE AND YET ABSTRACTED FASHION WHICH WAS PECULIAR TO HIM.\n",
      "\"WHY DID YOU COME AWAY TO CONSULT ME IN SUCH A HURRY?\" ASKED SHERLOCK HOLMES, WITH HIS FINGER-TIPS TOGETHER AND HIS EYES TO THE CEILING.\n",
      "I HAD EXPECTED TO SEE SHERLOCK HOLMES IMPATIENT UNDER THIS RAMBLING AND INCONSEQUENTIAL NARRATIVE, BUT, ON THE CONTRARY, HE HAD LISTENED WITH THE GREATEST CONCENTRATION OF ATTENTION.\n",
      "SHERLOCK HOLMES SAT SILENT FOR A FEW MINUTES WITH HIS FINGERTIPS STILL PRESSED TOGETHER, HIS LEGS STRETCHED OUT IN FRONT OF HIM, AND HIS GAZE DIRECTED UPWARD TO THE CEILING. THEN HE TOOK DOWN FROM THE RACK THE OLD AND OILY CLAY PIPE, WHICH WAS TO HIM AS A COUNSELLOR, AND, HAVING LIT IT, HE LEANED BACK IN HIS CHAIR, WITH THE THICK BLUE CLOUD-WREATHS SPINNING UP FROM HIM, AND A LOOK OF INFINITE LANGUOR IN HIS FACE.\n",
      "SHERLOCK HOLMES CLAPPED HIS HANDS SOFTLY TOGETHER AND CHUCKLED.\n",
      "A PROFESSIONAL CASE OF GREAT GRAVITY WAS ENGAGING MY OWN ATTENTION AT THE TIME, AND THE WHOLE OF NEXT DAY I WAS BUSY AT THE BEDSIDE OF THE SUFFERER. IT WAS NOT UNTIL CLOSE UPON SIX O'CLOCK THAT I FOUND MYSELF FREE AND WAS ABLE TO SPRING INTO A HANSOM AND DRIVE TO BAKER STREET, HALF AFRAID THAT I MIGHT BE TOO LATE TO ASSIST AT THE DENOUEMENT OF THE LITTLE MYSTERY. I FOUND SHERLOCK HOLMES ALONE, HOWEVER, HALF ASLEEP, WITH HIS LONG, THIN FORM CURLED UP IN THE RECESSES OF HIS ARMCHAIR. A FORMIDABLE ARRAY OF BOTTLES AND TEST-TUBES, WITH THE PUNGENT CLEANLY SMELL OF HYDROCHLORIC ACID, TOLD ME THAT HE HAD SPENT HIS DAY IN THE CHEMICAL WORK WHICH WAS SO DEAR TO HIM.\n",
      "WE WERE SEATED AT BREAKFAST ONE MORNING, MY WIFE AND I, WHEN THE MAID BROUGHT IN A TELEGRAM. IT WAS FROM SHERLOCK HOLMES AND RAN IN THIS WAY:\n",
      "\"OH, ANSTRUTHER WOULD DO YOUR WORK FOR YOU. YOU HAVE BEEN LOOKING A LITTLE PALE LATELY. I THINK THAT THE CHANGE WOULD DO YOU GOOD, AND YOU ARE ALWAYS SO INTERESTED IN MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES' CASES.\"\n",
      "MY EXPERIENCE OF CAMP LIFE IN AFGHANISTAN HAD AT LEAST HAD THE EFFECT OF MAKING ME A PROMPT AND READY TRAVELLER. MY WANTS WERE FEW AND SIMPLE, SO THAT IN LESS THAN THE TIME STATED I WAS IN A CAB WITH MY VALISE, RATTLING AWAY TO PADDINGTON STATION. SHERLOCK HOLMES WAS PACING UP AND DOWN THE PLATFORM, HIS TALL, GAUNT FIGURE MADE EVEN GAUNTER AND TALLER BY HIS LONG GREY TRAVELLING-CLOAK AND CLOSE-FITTING CLOTH CAP.\n",
      "\"OH, MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES!\" SHE CRIED, GLANCING FROM ONE TO THE OTHER OF US, AND FINALLY, WITH A WOMAN'S QUICK INTUITION, FASTENING UPON MY COMPANION, \"I AM SO GLAD THAT YOU HAVE COME. I HAVE DRIVEN DOWN TO TELL YOU SO. I KNOW THAT JAMES DIDN'T DO IT. I KNOW IT, AND I WANT YOU TO START UPON YOUR WORK KNOWING IT, TOO. NEVER LET YOURSELF DOUBT UPON THAT POINT. WE HAVE KNOWN EACH OTHER SINCE WE WERE LITTLE CHILDREN, AND I KNOW HIS FAULTS AS NO ONE ELSE DOES; BUT HE IS TOO TENDER-HEARTED TO HURT A FLY. SUCH A CHARGE IS ABSURD TO ANYONE WHO REALLY KNOWS HIM.\"\n",
      "\"I HOPE WE MAY CLEAR HIM, MISS TURNER,\" SAID SHERLOCK HOLMES. \"YOU MAY RELY UPON MY DOING ALL THAT I CAN.\"\n",
      "I WALKED DOWN TO THE STATION WITH THEM, AND THEN WANDERED THROUGH THE STREETS OF THE LITTLE TOWN, FINALLY RETURNING TO THE HOTEL, WHERE I LAY UPON THE SOFA AND TRIED TO INTEREST MYSELF IN A YELLOW-BACKED NOVEL. THE PUNY PLOT OF THE STORY WAS SO THIN, HOWEVER, WHEN COMPARED TO THE DEEP MYSTERY THROUGH WHICH WE WERE GROPING, AND I FOUND MY ATTENTION WANDER SO CONTINUALLY FROM THE ACTION TO THE FACT, THAT I AT LAST FLUNG IT ACROSS THE ROOM AND GAVE MYSELF UP ENTIRELY TO A CONSIDERATION OF THE EVENTS OF THE DAY. SUPPOSING THAT THIS UNHAPPY YOUNG MAN'S STORY WERE ABSOLUTELY TRUE, THEN WHAT HELLISH THING, WHAT ABSOLUTELY UNFORESEEN AND EXTRAORDINARY CALAMITY COULD HAVE OCCURRED BETWEEN THE TIME WHEN HE PARTED FROM HIS FATHER, AND THE MOMENT WHEN, DRAWN BACK BY HIS SCREAMS, HE RUSHED INTO THE GLADE? IT WAS SOMETHING TERRIBLE AND DEADLY. WHAT COULD IT BE? MIGHT NOT THE NATURE OF THE INJURIES REVEAL SOMETHING TO MY MEDICAL INSTINCTS? I RANG THE BELL AND CALLED FOR THE WEEKLY COUNTY PAPER, WHICH CONTAINED A VERBATIM ACCOUNT OF THE INQUEST. IN THE SURGEON'S DEPOSITION IT WAS STATED THAT THE POSTERIOR THIRD OF THE LEFT PARIETAL BONE AND THE LEFT HALF OF THE OCCIPITAL BONE HAD BEEN SHATTERED BY A HEAVY BLOW FROM A BLUNT WEAPON. I MARKED THE SPOT UPON MY OWN HEAD. CLEARLY SUCH A BLOW MUST HAVE BEEN STRUCK FROM BEHIND. THAT WAS TO SOME EXTENT IN FAVOUR OF THE ACCUSED, AS WHEN SEEN QUARRELLING HE WAS FACE TO FACE WITH HIS FATHER. STILL, IT DID NOT GO FOR VERY MUCH, FOR THE OLDER MAN MIGHT HAVE TURNED HIS BACK BEFORE THE BLOW FELL. STILL, IT MIGHT BE WORTH WHILE TO CALL HOLMES' ATTENTION TO IT. THEN THERE WAS THE PECULIAR DYING REFERENCE TO A RAT. WHAT COULD THAT MEAN? IT COULD NOT BE DELIRIUM. A MAN DYING FROM A SUDDEN BLOW DOES NOT COMMONLY BECOME DELIRIOUS. NO, IT WAS MORE LIKELY TO BE AN ATTEMPT TO EXPLAIN HOW HE MET HIS FATE. BUT WHAT COULD IT INDICATE? I CUDGELLED MY BRAINS TO FIND SOME POSSIBLE EXPLANATION. AND THEN THE INCIDENT OF THE GREY CLOTH SEEN BY YOUNG MCCARTHY. IF THAT WERE TRUE THE MURDERER MUST HAVE DROPPED SOME PART OF HIS DRESS, PRESUMABLY HIS OVERCOAT, IN HIS FLIGHT, AND MUST HAVE HAD THE HARDIHOOD TO RETURN AND TO CARRY IT AWAY AT THE INSTANT WHEN THE SON WAS KNEELING WITH HIS BACK TURNED NOT A DOZEN PACES OFF. WHAT A TISSUE OF MYSTERIES AND IMPROBABILITIES THE WHOLE THING WAS! I DID NOT WONDER AT LESTRADE'S OPINION, AND YET I HAD SO MUCH FAITH IN SHERLOCK HOLMES' INSIGHT THAT I COULD NOT LOSE HOPE AS LONG AS EVERY FRESH FACT SEEMED TO STRENGTHEN HIS CONVICTION OF YOUNG MCCARTHY'S INNOCENCE.\n",
      "IT WAS LATE BEFORE SHERLOCK HOLMES RETURNED. HE CAME BACK ALONE, FOR LESTRADE WAS STAYING IN LODGINGS IN THE TOWN.\n",
      "SHERLOCK HOLMES WAS TRANSFORMED WHEN HE WAS HOT UPON SUCH A SCENT AS THIS. MEN WHO HAD ONLY KNOWN THE QUIET THINKER AND LOGICIAN OF BAKER STREET WOULD HAVE FAILED TO RECOGNISE HIM. HIS FACE FLUSHED AND DARKENED. HIS BROWS WERE DRAWN INTO TWO HARD BLACK LINES, WHILE HIS EYES SHONE OUT FROM BENEATH THEM WITH A STEELY GLITTER. HIS FACE WAS BENT DOWNWARD, HIS SHOULDERS BOWED, HIS LIPS COMPRESSED, AND THE VEINS STOOD OUT LIKE WHIPCORD IN HIS LONG, SINEWY NECK. HIS NOSTRILS SEEMED TO DILATE WITH A PURELY ANIMAL LUST FOR THE CHASE, AND HIS MIND WAS SO ABSOLUTELY CONCENTRATED UPON THE MATTER BEFORE HIM THAT A QUESTION OR REMARK FELL UNHEEDED UPON HIS EARS, OR, AT THE MOST, ONLY PROVOKED A QUICK, IMPATIENT SNARL IN REPLY. SWIFTLY AND SILENTLY HE MADE HIS WAY ALONG THE TRACK WHICH RAN THROUGH THE MEADOWS, AND SO BY WAY OF THE WOODS TO THE BOSCOMBE POOL. IT WAS DAMP, MARSHY GROUND, AS IS ALL THAT DISTRICT, AND THERE WERE MARKS OF MANY FEET, BOTH UPON THE PATH AND AMID THE SHORT GRASS WHICH BOUNDED IT ON EITHER SIDE. SOMETIMES HOLMES WOULD HURRY ON, SOMETIMES STOP DEAD, AND ONCE HE MADE QUITE A LITTLE DETOUR INTO THE MEADOW. LESTRADE AND I WALKED BEHIND HIM, THE DETECTIVE INDIFFERENT AND CONTEMPTUOUS, WHILE I WATCHED MY FRIEND WITH THE INTEREST WHICH SPRANG FROM THE CONVICTION THAT EVERY ONE OF HIS ACTIONS WAS DIRECTED TOWARDS A DEFINITE END.\n",
      "SHERLOCK HOLMES TOOK A FOLDED PAPER FROM HIS POCKET AND FLATTENED IT OUT ON THE TABLE. \"THIS IS A MAP OF THE COLONY OF VICTORIA,\" HE SAID. \"I WIRED TO BRISTOL FOR IT LAST NIGHT.\" HE PUT HIS HAND OVER PART OF THE MAP. \"WHAT DO YOU READ?\"\n",
      "\"GOD HELP US!\" SAID HOLMES AFTER A LONG SILENCE. \"WHY DOES FATE PLAY SUCH TRICKS WITH POOR, HELPLESS WORMS? I NEVER HEAR OF SUCH A CASE AS THIS THAT I DO NOT THINK OF BAXTER'S WORDS, AND SAY, 'THERE, BUT FOR THE GRACE OF GOD, GOES SHERLOCK HOLMES.' \"\n",
      "WHEN I GLANCE OVER MY NOTES AND RECORDS OF THE SHERLOCK HOLMES CASES BETWEEN THE YEARS '82 AND '90, I AM FACED BY SO MANY WHICH PRESENT STRANGE AND INTERESTING FEATURES THAT IT IS NO EASY MATTER TO KNOW WHICH TO CHOOSE AND WHICH TO LEAVE. SOME, HOWEVER, HAVE ALREADY GAINED PUBLICITY THROUGH THE PAPERS, AND OTHERS HAVE NOT OFFERED A FIELD FOR THOSE PECULIAR QUALITIES WHICH MY FRIEND POSSESSED IN SO HIGH A DEGREE, AND WHICH IT IS THE OBJECT OF THESE PAPERS TO ILLUSTRATE. SOME, TOO, HAVE BAFFLED HIS ANALYTICAL SKILL, AND WOULD BE, AS NARRATIVES, BEGINNINGS WITHOUT AN ENDING, WHILE OTHERS HAVE BEEN BUT PARTIALLY CLEARED UP, AND HAVE THEIR EXPLANATIONS FOUNDED RATHER UPON CONJECTURE AND SURMISE THAN ON THAT ABSOLUTE LOGICAL PROOF WHICH WAS SO DEAR TO HIM. THERE IS, HOWEVER, ONE OF THESE LAST WHICH WAS SO REMARKABLE IN ITS DETAILS AND SO STARTLING IN ITS RESULTS THAT I AM TEMPTED TO GIVE SOME ACCOUNT OF IT IN SPITE OF THE FACT THAT THERE ARE POINTS IN CONNECTION WITH IT WHICH NEVER HAVE BEEN, AND PROBABLY NEVER WILL BE, ENTIRELY CLEARED UP.\n",
      "THE YEAR '87 FURNISHED US WITH A LONG SERIES OF CASES OF GREATER OR LESS INTEREST, OF WHICH I RETAIN THE RECORDS. AMONG MY HEADINGS UNDER THIS ONE TWELVE MONTHS I FIND AN ACCOUNT OF THE ADVENTURE OF THE PARADOL CHAMBER, OF THE AMATEUR MENDICANT SOCIETY, WHO HELD A LUXURIOUS CLUB IN THE LOWER VAULT OF A FURNITURE WAREHOUSE, OF THE FACTS CONNECTED WITH THE LOSS OF THE BRITISH BARQUE SOPHY ANDERSON, OF THE SINGULAR ADVENTURES OF THE GRICE PATERSONS IN THE ISLAND OF UFFA, AND FINALLY OF THE CAMBERWELL POISONING CASE. IN THE LATTER, AS MAY BE REMEMBERED, SHERLOCK HOLMES WAS ABLE, BY WINDING UP THE DEAD MAN'S WATCH, TO PROVE THAT IT HAD BEEN WOUND UP TWO HOURS BEFORE, AND THAT THEREFORE THE DECEASED HAD GONE TO BED WITHIN THAT TIME--A DEDUCTION WHICH WAS OF THE GREATEST IMPORTANCE IN CLEARING UP THE CASE. ALL THESE I MAY SKETCH OUT AT SOME FUTURE DATE, BUT NONE OF THEM PRESENT SUCH SINGULAR FEATURES AS THE STRANGE TRAIN OF CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH I HAVE NOW TAKEN UP MY PEN TO DESCRIBE.\n",
      "IT WAS IN THE LATTER DAYS OF SEPTEMBER, AND THE EQUINOCTIAL GALES HAD SET IN WITH EXCEPTIONAL VIOLENCE. ALL DAY THE WIND HAD SCREAMED AND THE RAIN HAD BEATEN AGAINST THE WINDOWS, SO THAT EVEN HERE IN THE HEART OF GREAT, HAND-MADE LONDON WE WERE FORCED TO RAISE OUR MINDS FOR THE INSTANT FROM THE ROUTINE OF LIFE AND TO RECOGNISE THE PRESENCE OF THOSE GREAT ELEMENTAL FORCES WHICH SHRIEK AT MANKIND THROUGH THE BARS OF HIS CIVILISATION, LIKE UNTAMED BEASTS IN A CAGE. AS EVENING DREW IN, THE STORM GREW HIGHER AND LOUDER, AND THE WIND CRIED AND SOBBED LIKE A CHILD IN THE CHIMNEY. SHERLOCK HOLMES SAT MOODILY AT ONE SIDE OF THE FIREPLACE CROSS-INDEXING HIS RECORDS OF CRIME, WHILE I AT THE OTHER WAS DEEP IN ONE OF CLARK RUSSELL'S FINE SEA-STORIES UNTIL THE HOWL OF THE GALE FROM WITHOUT SEEMED TO BLEND WITH THE TEXT, AND THE SPLASH OF THE RAIN TO LENGTHEN OUT INTO THE LONG SWASH OF THE SEA WAVES. MY WIFE WAS ON A VISIT TO HER MOTHER'S, AND FOR A FEW DAYS I WAS A DWELLER ONCE MORE IN MY OLD QUARTERS AT BAKER STREET.\n",
      "SHERLOCK HOLMES WAS WRONG IN HIS CONJECTURE, HOWEVER, FOR THERE CAME A STEP IN THE PASSAGE AND A TAPPING AT THE DOOR. HE STRETCHED OUT HIS LONG ARM TO TURN THE LAMP AWAY FROM HIMSELF AND TOWARDS THE VACANT CHAIR UPON WHICH A NEWCOMER MUST SIT.\n",
      "\"TUT! TUT!\" CRIED SHERLOCK HOLMES. \"YOU MUST ACT, MAN, OR YOU ARE LOST. NOTHING BUT ENERGY CAN SAVE YOU. THIS IS NO TIME FOR DESPAIR.\"\n",
      "SHERLOCK HOLMES SAT FOR SOME TIME IN SILENCE, WITH HIS HEAD SUNK FORWARD AND HIS EYES BENT UPON THE RED GLOW OF THE FIRE. THEN HE LIT HIS PIPE, AND LEANING BACK IN HIS CHAIR HE WATCHED THE BLUE SMOKE-RINGS AS THEY CHASED EACH OTHER UP TO THE CEILING.\n",
      "SHERLOCK HOLMES CLOSED HIS EYES AND PLACED HIS ELBOWS UPON THE ARMS OF HIS CHAIR, WITH HIS FINGER-TIPS TOGETHER. \"THE IDEAL REASONER,\" HE REMARKED, \"WOULD, WHEN HE HAD ONCE BEEN SHOWN A SINGLE FACT IN ALL ITS BEARINGS, DEDUCE FROM IT NOT ONLY ALL THE CHAIN OF EVENTS WHICH LED UP TO IT BUT ALSO ALL THE RESULTS WHICH WOULD FOLLOW FROM IT. AS CUVIER COULD CORRECTLY DESCRIBE A WHOLE ANIMAL BY THE CONTEMPLATION OF A SINGLE BONE, SO THE OBSERVER WHO HAS THOROUGHLY UNDERSTOOD ONE LINK IN A SERIES OF INCIDENTS SHOULD BE ABLE TO ACCURATELY STATE ALL THE OTHER ONES, BOTH BEFORE AND AFTER. WE HAVE NOT YET GRASPED THE RESULTS WHICH THE REASON ALONE CAN ATTAIN TO. PROBLEMS MAY BE SOLVED IN THE STUDY WHICH HAVE BAFFLED ALL THOSE WHO HAVE SOUGHT A SOLUTION BY THE AID OF THEIR SENSES. TO CARRY THE ART, HOWEVER, TO ITS HIGHEST PITCH, IT IS NECESSARY THAT THE REASONER SHOULD BE ABLE TO UTILISE ALL THE FACTS WHICH HAVE COME TO HIS KNOWLEDGE; AND THIS IN ITSELF IMPLIES, AS YOU WILL READILY SEE, A POSSESSION OF ALL KNOWLEDGE, WHICH, EVEN IN THESE DAYS OF FREE EDUCATION AND ENCYCLOPAEDIAS, IS A SOMEWHAT RARE ACCOMPLISHMENT. IT IS NOT SO IMPOSSIBLE, HOWEVER, THAT A MAN SHOULD POSSESS ALL KNOWLEDGE WHICH IS LIKELY TO BE USEFUL TO HIM IN HIS WORK, AND THIS I HAVE ENDEAVOURED IN MY CASE TO DO. IF I REMEMBER RIGHTLY, YOU ON ONE OCCASION, IN THE EARLY DAYS OF OUR FRIENDSHIP, DEFINED MY LIMITS IN A VERY PRECISE FASHION.\"\n",
      "\"HAVE YOU NEVER--\" SAID SHERLOCK HOLMES, BENDING FORWARD AND SINKING HIS VOICE--\"HAVE YOU NEVER HEARD OF THE KU KLUX KLAN?\"\n",
      "IT HAD CLEARED IN THE MORNING, AND THE SUN WAS SHINING WITH A SUBDUED BRIGHTNESS THROUGH THE DIM VEIL WHICH HANGS OVER THE GREAT CITY. SHERLOCK HOLMES WAS ALREADY AT BREAKFAST WHEN I CAME DOWN.\n",
      "ALL DAY I WAS ENGAGED IN MY PROFESSIONAL WORK, AND IT WAS LATE IN THE EVENING BEFORE I RETURNED TO BAKER STREET. SHERLOCK HOLMES HAD NOT COME BACK YET. IT WAS NEARLY TEN O'CLOCK BEFORE HE ENTERED, LOOKING PALE AND WORN. HE WALKED UP TO THE SIDEBOARD, AND TEARING A PIECE FROM THE LOAF HE DEVOURED IT VORACIOUSLY, WASHING IT DOWN WITH A LONG DRAUGHT OF WATER.\n",
      "I WALKED DOWN THE NARROW PASSAGE BETWEEN THE DOUBLE ROW OF SLEEPERS, HOLDING MY BREATH TO KEEP OUT THE VILE, STUPEFYING FUMES OF THE DRUG, AND LOOKING ABOUT FOR THE MANAGER. AS I PASSED THE TALL MAN WHO SAT BY THE BRAZIER I FELT A SUDDEN PLUCK AT MY SKIRT, AND A LOW VOICE WHISPERED, \"WALK PAST ME, AND THEN LOOK BACK AT ME.\" THE WORDS FELL QUITE DISTINCTLY UPON MY EAR. I GLANCED DOWN. THEY COULD ONLY HAVE COME FROM THE OLD MAN AT MY SIDE, AND YET HE SAT NOW AS ABSORBED AS EVER, VERY THIN, VERY WRINKLED, BENT WITH AGE, AN OPIUM PIPE DANGLING DOWN FROM BETWEEN HIS KNEES, AS THOUGH IT HAD DROPPED IN SHEER LASSITUDE FROM HIS FINGERS. I TOOK TWO STEPS FORWARD AND LOOKED BACK. IT TOOK ALL MY SELF-CONTROL TO PREVENT ME FROM BREAKING OUT INTO A CRY OF ASTONISHMENT. HE HAD TURNED HIS BACK SO THAT NONE COULD SEE HIM BUT I. HIS FORM HAD FILLED OUT, HIS WRINKLES WERE GONE, THE DULL EYES HAD REGAINED THEIR FIRE, AND THERE, SITTING BY THE FIRE AND GRINNING AT MY SURPRISE, WAS NONE OTHER THAN SHERLOCK HOLMES. HE MADE A SLIGHT MOTION TO ME TO APPROACH HIM, AND INSTANTLY, AS HE TURNED HIS FACE HALF ROUND TO THE COMPANY ONCE MORE, SUBSIDED INTO A DODDERING, LOOSE-LIPPED SENILITY.\n",
      "IT WAS DIFFICULT TO REFUSE ANY OF SHERLOCK HOLMES' REQUESTS, FOR THEY WERE ALWAYS SO EXCEEDINGLY DEFINITE, AND PUT FORWARD WITH SUCH A QUIET AIR OF MASTERY. I FELT, HOWEVER, THAT WHEN WHITNEY WAS ONCE CONFINED IN THE CAB MY MISSION WAS PRACTICALLY ACCOMPLISHED; AND FOR THE REST, I COULD NOT WISH ANYTHING BETTER THAN TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH MY FRIEND IN ONE OF THOSE SINGULAR ADVENTURES WHICH WERE THE NORMAL CONDITION OF HIS EXISTENCE. IN A FEW MINUTES I HAD WRITTEN MY NOTE, PAID WHITNEY'S BILL, LED HIM OUT TO THE CAB, AND SEEN HIM DRIVEN THROUGH THE DARKNESS. IN A VERY SHORT TIME A DECREPIT FIGURE HAD EMERGED FROM THE OPIUM DEN, AND I WAS WALKING DOWN THE STREET WITH SHERLOCK HOLMES. FOR TWO STREETS HE SHUFFLED ALONG WITH A BENT BACK AND AN UNCERTAIN FOOT. THEN, GLANCING QUICKLY ROUND, HE STRAIGHTENED HIMSELF OUT AND BURST INTO A HEARTY FIT OF LAUGHTER.\n",
      "WHILE SHERLOCK HOLMES HAD BEEN DETAILING THIS SINGULAR SERIES OF EVENTS, WE HAD BEEN WHIRLING THROUGH THE OUTSKIRTS OF THE GREAT TOWN UNTIL THE LAST STRAGGLING HOUSES HAD BEEN LEFT BEHIND, AND WE RATTLED ALONG WITH A COUNTRY HEDGE UPON EITHER SIDE OF US. JUST AS HE FINISHED, HOWEVER, WE DROVE THROUGH TWO SCATTERED VILLAGES, WHERE A FEW LIGHTS STILL GLIMMERED IN THE WINDOWS.\n",
      "\"NOW, MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES,\" SAID THE LADY AS WE ENTERED A WELL-LIT DINING-ROOM, UPON THE TABLE OF WHICH A COLD SUPPER HAD BEEN LAID OUT, \"I SHOULD VERY MUCH LIKE TO ASK YOU ONE OR TWO PLAIN QUESTIONS, TO WHICH I BEG THAT YOU WILL GIVE A PLAIN ANSWER.\"\n",
      "SHERLOCK HOLMES SEEMED TO BE EMBARRASSED BY THE QUESTION. \"FRANKLY, NOW!\" SHE REPEATED, STANDING UPON THE RUG AND LOOKING KEENLY DOWN AT HIM AS HE LEANED BACK IN A BASKET-CHAIR.\n",
      "SHERLOCK HOLMES SPRANG OUT OF HIS CHAIR AS IF HE HAD BEEN GALVANISED.\n",
      "A LARGE AND COMFORTABLE DOUBLE-BEDDED ROOM HAD BEEN PLACED AT OUR DISPOSAL, AND I WAS QUICKLY BETWEEN THE SHEETS, FOR I WAS WEARY AFTER MY NIGHT OF ADVENTURE. SHERLOCK HOLMES WAS A MAN, HOWEVER, WHO, WHEN HE HAD AN UNSOLVED PROBLEM UPON HIS MIND, WOULD GO FOR DAYS, AND EVEN FOR A WEEK, WITHOUT REST, TURNING IT OVER, REARRANGING HIS FACTS, LOOKING AT IT FROM EVERY POINT OF VIEW UNTIL HE HAD EITHER FATHOMED IT OR CONVINCED HIMSELF THAT HIS DATA WERE INSUFFICIENT. IT WAS SOON EVIDENT TO ME THAT HE WAS NOW PREPARING FOR AN ALL-NIGHT SITTING. HE TOOK OFF HIS COAT AND WAISTCOAT, PUT ON A LARGE BLUE DRESSING-GOWN, AND THEN WANDERED ABOUT THE ROOM COLLECTING PILLOWS FROM HIS BED AND CUSHIONS FROM THE SOFA AND ARMCHAIRS. WITH THESE HE CONSTRUCTED A SORT OF EASTERN DIVAN, UPON WHICH HE PERCHED HIMSELF CROSS-LEGGED, WITH AN OUNCE OF SHAG TOBACCO AND A BOX OF MATCHES LAID OUT IN FRONT OF HIM. IN THE DIM LIGHT OF THE LAMP I SAW HIM SITTING THERE, AN OLD BRIAR PIPE BETWEEN HIS LIPS, HIS EYES FIXED VACANTLY UPON THE CORNER OF THE CEILING, THE BLUE SMOKE CURLING UP FROM HIM, SILENT, MOTIONLESS, WITH THE LIGHT SHINING UPON HIS STRONG-SET AQUILINE FEATURES. SO HE SAT AS I DROPPED OFF TO SLEEP, AND SO HE SAT WHEN A SUDDEN EJACULATION CAUSED ME TO WAKE UP, AND I FOUND THE SUMMER SUN SHINING INTO THE APARTMENT. THE PIPE WAS STILL BETWEEN HIS LIPS, THE SMOKE STILL CURLED UPWARD, AND THE ROOM WAS FULL OF A DENSE TOBACCO HAZE, BUT NOTHING REMAINED OF THE HEAP OF SHAG WHICH I HAD SEEN UPON THE PREVIOUS NIGHT.\n",
      "IN TOWN THE EARLIEST RISERS WERE JUST BEGINNING TO LOOK SLEEPILY FROM THEIR WINDOWS AS WE DROVE THROUGH THE STREETS OF THE SURREY SIDE. PASSING DOWN THE WATERLOO BRIDGE ROAD WE CROSSED OVER THE RIVER, AND DASHING UP WELLINGTON STREET WHEELED SHARPLY TO THE RIGHT AND FOUND OURSELVES IN BOW STREET. SHERLOCK HOLMES WAS WELL KNOWN TO THE FORCE, AND THE TWO CONSTABLES AT THE DOOR SALUTED HIM. ONE OF THEM HELD THE HORSE'S HEAD WHILE THE OTHER LED US IN.\n",
      "SHERLOCK HOLMES SAT DOWN BESIDE HIM ON THE COUCH AND PATTED HIM KINDLY ON THE SHOULDER.\n",
      "I HAD CALLED UPON MY FRIEND SHERLOCK HOLMES UPON THE SECOND MORNING AFTER CHRISTMAS, WITH THE INTENTION OF WISHING HIM THE COMPLIMENTS OF THE SEASON. HE WAS LOUNGING UPON THE SOFA IN A PURPLE DRESSING-GOWN, A PIPE-RACK WITHIN HIS REACH UPON THE RIGHT, AND A PILE OF CRUMPLED MORNING PAPERS, EVIDENTLY NEWLY STUDIED, NEAR AT HAND. BESIDE THE COUCH WAS A WOODEN CHAIR, AND ON THE ANGLE OF THE BACK HUNG A VERY SEEDY AND DISREPUTABLE HARD-FELT HAT, MUCH THE WORSE FOR WEAR, AND CRACKED IN SEVERAL PLACES. A LENS AND A FORCEPS LYING UPON THE SEAT OF THE CHAIR SUGGESTED THAT THE HAT HAD BEEN SUSPENDED IN THIS MANNER FOR THE PURPOSE OF EXAMINATION.\n",
      "\"NO, NO. NO CRIME,\" SAID SHERLOCK HOLMES, LAUGHING. \"ONLY ONE OF THOSE WHIMSICAL LITTLE INCIDENTS WHICH WILL HAPPEN WHEN YOU HAVE FOUR MILLION HUMAN BEINGS ALL JOSTLING EACH OTHER WITHIN THE SPACE OF A FEW SQUARE MILES. AMID THE ACTION AND REACTION OF SO DENSE A SWARM OF HUMANITY, EVERY POSSIBLE COMBINATION OF EVENTS MAY BE EXPECTED TO TAKE PLACE, AND MANY A LITTLE PROBLEM WILL BE PRESENTED WHICH MAY BE STRIKING AND BIZARRE WITHOUT BEING CRIMINAL. WE HAVE ALREADY HAD EXPERIENCE OF SUCH.\"\n",
      "SHERLOCK HOLMES LAUGHED. \"HERE IS THE FORESIGHT,\" SAID HE PUTTING HIS FINGER UPON THE LITTLE DISC AND LOOP OF THE HAT-SECURER. \"THEY ARE NEVER SOLD UPON HATS. IF THIS MAN ORDERED ONE, IT IS A SIGN OF A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF FORESIGHT, SINCE HE WENT OUT OF HIS WAY TO TAKE THIS PRECAUTION AGAINST THE WIND. BUT SINCE WE SEE THAT HE HAS BROKEN THE ELASTIC AND HAS NOT TROUBLED TO REPLACE IT, IT IS OBVIOUS THAT HE HAS LESS FORESIGHT NOW THAN FORMERLY, WHICH IS A DISTINCT PROOF OF A WEAKENING NATURE. ON THE OTHER HAND, HE HAS ENDEAVOURED TO CONCEAL SOME OF THESE STAINS UPON THE FELT BY DAUBING THEM WITH INK, WHICH IS A SIGN THAT HE HAS NOT ENTIRELY LOST HIS SELF-RESPECT.\"\n",
      "SHERLOCK HOLMES HAD OPENED HIS MOUTH TO REPLY, WHEN THE DOOR FLEW OPEN, AND PETERSON, THE COMMISSIONAIRE, RUSHED INTO THE APARTMENT WITH FLUSHED CHEEKS AND THE FACE OF A MAN WHO IS DAZED WITH ASTONISHMENT.\n",
      "SHERLOCK HOLMES SAT UP WITH A WHISTLE. \"BY JOVE, PETERSON!\" SAID HE, \"THIS IS TREASURE TROVE INDEED. I SUPPOSE YOU KNOW WHAT YOU HAVE GOT?\"\n",
      "SHERLOCK HOLMES GLANCED SHARPLY ACROSS AT ME WITH A SLIGHT SHRUG OF HIS SHOULDERS.\n",
      "SHERLOCK HOLMES LOOKED DEEPLY CHAGRINED. HE DREW A SOVEREIGN FROM HIS POCKET AND THREW IT DOWN UPON THE SLAB, TURNING AWAY WITH THE AIR OF A MAN WHOSE DISGUST IS TOO DEEP FOR WORDS. A FEW YARDS OFF HE STOPPED UNDER A LAMP-POST AND LAUGHED IN THE HEARTY, NOISELESS FASHION WHICH WAS PECULIAR TO HIM.\n",
      "\"MY NAME IS SHERLOCK HOLMES. IT IS MY BUSINESS TO KNOW WHAT OTHER PEOPLE DON'T KNOW.\"\n",
      "SHERLOCK HOLMES HAILED A FOUR-WHEELER WHICH WAS PASSING. \"IN THAT CASE WE HAD BETTER DISCUSS IT IN A COSY ROOM RATHER THAN IN THIS WIND-SWEPT MARKET-PLACE,\" SAID HE. \"BUT PRAY TELL ME, BEFORE WE GO FARTHER, WHO IT IS THAT I HAVE THE PLEASURE OF ASSISTING.\"\n",
      "THERE WAS A LONG SILENCE, BROKEN ONLY BY HIS HEAVY BREATHING AND BY THE MEASURED TAPPING OF SHERLOCK HOLMES' FINGER-TIPS UPON THE EDGE OF THE TABLE. THEN MY FRIEND ROSE AND THREW OPEN THE DOOR.\n",
      "ON GLANCING OVER MY NOTES OF THE SEVENTY ODD CASES IN WHICH I HAVE DURING THE LAST EIGHT YEARS STUDIED THE METHODS OF MY FRIEND SHERLOCK HOLMES, I FIND MANY TRAGIC, SOME COMIC, A LARGE NUMBER MERELY STRANGE, BUT NONE COMMONPLACE; FOR, WORKING AS HE DID RATHER FOR THE LOVE OF HIS ART THAN FOR THE ACQUIREMENT OF WEALTH, HE REFUSED TO ASSOCIATE HIMSELF WITH ANY INVESTIGATION WHICH DID NOT TEND TOWARDS THE UNUSUAL, AND EVEN THE FANTASTIC. OF ALL THESE VARIED CASES, HOWEVER, I CANNOT RECALL ANY WHICH PRESENTED MORE SINGULAR FEATURES THAN THAT WHICH WAS ASSOCIATED WITH THE WELL-KNOWN SURREY FAMILY OF THE ROYLOTTS OF STOKE MORAN. THE EVENTS IN QUESTION OCCURRED IN THE EARLY DAYS OF MY ASSOCIATION WITH HOLMES, WHEN WE WERE SHARING ROOMS AS BACHELORS IN BAKER STREET. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT I MIGHT HAVE PLACED THEM UPON RECORD BEFORE, BUT A PROMISE OF SECRECY WAS MADE AT THE TIME, FROM WHICH I HAVE ONLY BEEN FREED DURING THE LAST MONTH BY THE UNTIMELY DEATH OF THE LADY TO WHOM THE PLEDGE WAS GIVEN. IT IS PERHAPS AS WELL THAT THE FACTS SHOULD NOW COME TO LIGHT, FOR I HAVE REASONS TO KNOW THAT THERE ARE WIDESPREAD RUMOURS AS TO THE DEATH OF DR. GRIMESBY ROYLOTT WHICH TEND TO MAKE THE MATTER EVEN MORE TERRIBLE THAN THE TRUTH.\n",
      "IT WAS EARLY IN APRIL IN THE YEAR '83 THAT I WOKE ONE MORNING TO FIND SHERLOCK HOLMES STANDING, FULLY DRESSED, BY THE SIDE OF MY BED. HE WAS A LATE RISER, AS A RULE, AND AS THE CLOCK ON THE MANTELPIECE SHOWED ME THAT IT WAS ONLY A QUARTER-PAST SEVEN, I BLINKED UP AT HIM IN SOME SURPRISE, AND PERHAPS JUST A LITTLE RESENTMENT, FOR I WAS MYSELF REGULAR IN MY HABITS.\n",
      "\"GOOD-MORNING, MADAM,\" SAID HOLMES CHEERILY. \"MY NAME IS SHERLOCK HOLMES. THIS IS MY INTIMATE FRIEND AND ASSOCIATE, DR. WATSON, BEFORE WHOM YOU CAN SPEAK AS FREELY AS BEFORE MYSELF. HA! I AM GLAD TO SEE THAT MRS. HUDSON HAS HAD THE GOOD SENSE TO LIGHT THE FIRE. PRAY DRAW UP TO IT, AND I SHALL ORDER YOU A CUP OF HOT COFFEE, FOR I OBSERVE THAT YOU ARE SHIVERING.\"\n",
      "\"IT IS FEAR, MR. HOLMES. IT IS TERROR.\" SHE RAISED HER VEIL AS SHE SPOKE, AND WE COULD SEE THAT SHE WAS INDEED IN A PITIABLE STATE OF AGITATION, HER FACE ALL DRAWN AND GREY, WITH RESTLESS FRIGHTENED EYES, LIKE THOSE OF SOME HUNTED ANIMAL. HER FEATURES AND FIGURE WERE THOSE OF A WOMAN OF THIRTY, BUT HER HAIR WAS SHOT WITH PREMATURE GREY, AND HER EXPRESSION WAS WEARY AND HAGGARD. SHERLOCK HOLMES RAN HER OVER WITH ONE OF HIS QUICK, ALL-COMPREHENSIVE GLANCES.\n",
      "SHERLOCK HOLMES HAD BEEN LEANING BACK IN HIS CHAIR WITH HIS EYES CLOSED AND HIS HEAD SUNK IN A CUSHION, BUT HE HALF OPENED HIS LIDS NOW AND GLANCED ACROSS AT HIS VISITOR.\n",
      "\"AND WHAT DO YOU THINK OF IT ALL, WATSON?\" ASKED SHERLOCK HOLMES, LEANING BACK IN HIS CHAIR.\n",
      "IT WAS NEARLY ONE O'CLOCK WHEN SHERLOCK HOLMES RETURNED FROM HIS EXCURSION. HE HELD IN HIS HAND A SHEET OF BLUE PAPER, SCRAWLED OVER WITH NOTES AND FIGURES.\n",
      "SHERLOCK HOLMES AND I HAD NO DIFFICULTY IN ENGAGING A BEDROOM AND SITTING-ROOM AT THE CROWN INN. THEY WERE ON THE UPPER FLOOR, AND FROM OUR WINDOW WE COULD COMMAND A VIEW OF THE AVENUE GATE, AND OF THE INHABITED WING OF STOKE MORAN MANOR HOUSE. AT DUSK WE SAW DR. GRIMESBY ROYLOTT DRIVE PAST, HIS HUGE FORM LOOMING UP BESIDE THE LITTLE FIGURE OF THE LAD WHO DROVE HIM. THE BOY HAD SOME SLIGHT DIFFICULTY IN UNDOING THE HEAVY IRON GATES, AND WE HEARD THE HOARSE ROAR OF THE DOCTOR'S VOICE AND SAW THE FURY WITH WHICH HE SHOOK HIS CLINCHED FISTS AT HIM. THE TRAP DROVE ON, AND A FEW MINUTES LATER WE SAW A SUDDEN LIGHT SPRING UP AMONG THE TREES AS THE LAMP WAS LIT IN ONE OF THE SITTING-ROOMS.\n",
      "SUCH ARE THE TRUE FACTS OF THE DEATH OF DR. GRIMESBY ROYLOTT, OF STOKE MORAN. IT IS NOT NECESSARY THAT I SHOULD PROLONG A NARRATIVE WHICH HAS ALREADY RUN TO TOO GREAT A LENGTH BY TELLING HOW WE BROKE THE SAD NEWS TO THE TERRIFIED GIRL, HOW WE CONVEYED HER BY THE MORNING TRAIN TO THE CARE OF HER GOOD AUNT AT HARROW, OF HOW THE SLOW PROCESS OF OFFICIAL INQUIRY CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THE DOCTOR MET HIS FATE WHILE INDISCREETLY PLAYING WITH A DANGEROUS PET. THE LITTLE WHICH I HAD YET TO LEARN OF THE CASE WAS TOLD ME BY SHERLOCK HOLMES AS WE TRAVELLED BACK NEXT DAY.\n",
      "OF ALL THE PROBLEMS WHICH HAVE BEEN SUBMITTED TO MY FRIEND, MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES, FOR SOLUTION DURING THE YEARS OF OUR INTIMACY, THERE WERE ONLY TWO WHICH I WAS THE MEANS OF INTRODUCING TO HIS NOTICE--THAT OF MR. HATHERLEY'S THUMB, AND THAT OF COLONEL WARBURTON'S MADNESS. OF THESE THE LATTER MAY HAVE AFFORDED A FINER FIELD FOR AN ACUTE AND ORIGINAL OBSERVER, BUT THE OTHER WAS SO STRANGE IN ITS INCEPTION AND SO DRAMATIC IN ITS DETAILS THAT IT MAY BE THE MORE WORTHY OF BEING PLACED UPON RECORD, EVEN IF IT GAVE MY FRIEND FEWER OPENINGS FOR THOSE DEDUCTIVE METHODS OF REASONING BY WHICH HE ACHIEVED SUCH REMARKABLE RESULTS. THE STORY HAS, I BELIEVE, BEEN TOLD MORE THAN ONCE IN THE NEWSPAPERS, BUT, LIKE ALL SUCH NARRATIVES, ITS EFFECT IS MUCH LESS STRIKING WHEN SET FORTH EN BLOC IN A SINGLE HALF-COLUMN OF PRINT THAN WHEN THE FACTS SLOWLY EVOLVE BEFORE YOUR OWN EYES, AND THE MYSTERY CLEARS GRADUALLY AWAY AS EACH NEW DISCOVERY FURNISHES A STEP WHICH LEADS ON TO THE COMPLETE TRUTH. AT THE TIME THE CIRCUMSTANCES MADE A DEEP IMPRESSION UPON ME, AND THE LAPSE OF TWO YEARS HAS HARDLY SERVED TO WEAKEN THE EFFECT.\n",
      "\"HA!\" CRIED I, \"IF IT IS ANYTHING IN THE NATURE OF A PROBLEM WHICH YOU DESIRE TO SEE SOLVED, I SHOULD STRONGLY RECOMMEND YOU TO COME TO MY FRIEND, MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES, BEFORE YOU GO TO THE OFFICIAL POLICE.\"\n",
      "SHERLOCK HOLMES WAS, AS I EXPECTED, LOUNGING ABOUT HIS SITTING-ROOM IN HIS DRESSING-GOWN, READING THE AGONY COLUMN OF THE TIMES AND SMOKING HIS BEFORE-BREAKFAST PIPE, WHICH WAS COMPOSED OF ALL THE PLUGS AND DOTTLES LEFT FROM HIS SMOKES OF THE DAY BEFORE, ALL CAREFULLY DRIED AND COLLECTED ON THE CORNER OF THE MANTELPIECE. HE RECEIVED US IN HIS QUIETLY GENIAL FASHION, ORDERED FRESH RASHERS AND EGGS, AND JOINED US IN A HEARTY MEAL. WHEN IT WAS CONCLUDED HE SETTLED OUR NEW ACQUAINTANCE UPON THE SOFA, PLACED A PILLOW BENEATH HIS HEAD, AND LAID A GLASS OF BRANDY AND WATER WITHIN HIS REACH.\n",
      "WE BOTH SAT IN SILENCE FOR SOME LITTLE TIME AFTER LISTENING TO THIS EXTRAORDINARY NARRATIVE. THEN SHERLOCK HOLMES PULLED DOWN FROM THE SHELF ONE OF THE PONDEROUS COMMONPLACE BOOKS IN WHICH HE PLACED HIS CUTTINGS.\n",
      "SOME THREE HOURS OR SO AFTERWARDS WE WERE ALL IN THE TRAIN TOGETHER, BOUND FROM READING TO THE LITTLE BERKSHIRE VILLAGE. THERE WERE SHERLOCK HOLMES, THE HYDRAULIC ENGINEER, INSPECTOR BRADSTREET, OF SCOTLAND YARD, A PLAIN-CLOTHES MAN, AND MYSELF. BRADSTREET HAD SPREAD AN ORDNANCE MAP OF THE COUNTY OUT UPON THE SEAT AND WAS BUSY WITH HIS COMPASSES DRAWING A CIRCLE WITH EYFORD FOR ITS CENTRE.\n",
      "THE LORD ST. SIMON MARRIAGE, AND ITS CURIOUS TERMINATION, HAVE LONG CEASED TO BE A SUBJECT OF INTEREST IN THOSE EXALTED CIRCLES IN WHICH THE UNFORTUNATE BRIDEGROOM MOVES. FRESH SCANDALS HAVE ECLIPSED IT, AND THEIR MORE PIQUANT DETAILS HAVE DRAWN THE GOSSIPS AWAY FROM THIS FOUR-YEAR-OLD DRAMA. AS I HAVE REASON TO BELIEVE, HOWEVER, THAT THE FULL FACTS HAVE NEVER BEEN REVEALED TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC, AND AS MY FRIEND SHERLOCK HOLMES HAD A CONSIDERABLE SHARE IN CLEARING THE MATTER UP, I FEEL THAT NO MEMOIR OF HIM WOULD BE COMPLETE WITHOUT SOME LITTLE SKETCH OF THIS REMARKABLE EPISODE.\n",
      "\" 'MY DEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES:--LORD BACKWATER TELLS ME THAT I MAY PLACE IMPLICIT RELIANCE UPON YOUR JUDGMENT AND DISCRETION. I HAVE DETERMINED, THEREFORE, TO CALL UPON YOU AND TO CONSULT YOU IN REFERENCE TO THE VERY PAINFUL EVENT WHICH HAS OCCURRED IN CONNECTION WITH MY WEDDING. MR. LESTRADE, OF SCOTLAND YARD, IS ACTING ALREADY IN THE MATTER, BUT HE ASSURES ME THAT HE SEES NO OBJECTION TO YOUR CO-OPERATION, AND THAT HE EVEN THINKS THAT IT MIGHT BE OF SOME ASSISTANCE. I WILL CALL AT FOUR O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON, AND, SHOULD YOU HAVE ANY OTHER ENGAGEMENT AT THAT TIME, I HOPE THAT YOU WILL POSTPONE IT, AS THIS MATTER IS OF PARAMOUNT IMPORTANCE. YOURS FAITHFULLY,\n",
      "\"IT IS VERY GOOD OF LORD ST. SIMON TO HONOUR MY HEAD BY PUTTING IT ON A LEVEL WITH HIS OWN,\" SAID SHERLOCK HOLMES, LAUGHING. \"I THINK THAT I SHALL HAVE A WHISKY AND SODA AND A CIGAR AFTER ALL THIS CROSS-QUESTIONING. I HAD FORMED MY CONCLUSIONS AS TO THE CASE BEFORE OUR CLIENT CAME INTO THE ROOM.\"\n",
      "SHERLOCK HOLMES LEANED BACK IN HIS CHAIR AND LAUGHED HEARTILY.\n",
      "IT WAS AFTER FIVE O'CLOCK WHEN SHERLOCK HOLMES LEFT ME, BUT I HAD NO TIME TO BE LONELY, FOR WITHIN AN HOUR THERE ARRIVED A CONFECTIONER'S MAN WITH A VERY LARGE FLAT BOX. THIS HE UNPACKED WITH THE HELP OF A YOUTH WHOM HE HAD BROUGHT WITH HIM, AND PRESENTLY, TO MY VERY GREAT ASTONISHMENT, A QUITE EPICUREAN LITTLE COLD SUPPER BEGAN TO BE LAID OUT UPON OUR HUMBLE LODGING-HOUSE MAHOGANY. THERE WERE A COUPLE OF BRACE OF COLD WOODCOCK, A PHEASANT, A PATE DE FOIE GRAS PIE WITH A GROUP OF ANCIENT AND COBWEBBY BOTTLES. HAVING LAID OUT ALL THESE LUXURIES, MY TWO VISITORS VANISHED AWAY, LIKE THE GENII OF THE ARABIAN NIGHTS, WITH NO EXPLANATION SAVE THAT THE THINGS HAD BEEN PAID FOR AND WERE ORDERED TO THIS ADDRESS.\n",
      "JUST BEFORE NINE O'CLOCK SHERLOCK HOLMES STEPPED BRISKLY INTO THE ROOM. HIS FEATURES WERE GRAVELY SET, BUT THERE WAS A LIGHT IN HIS EYE WHICH MADE ME THINK THAT HE HAD NOT BEEN DISAPPOINTED IN HIS CONCLUSIONS.\n",
      "\"THEN I TRUST THAT YOU AT LEAST WILL HONOUR ME WITH YOUR COMPANY,\" SAID SHERLOCK HOLMES. \"IT IS ALWAYS A JOY TO MEET AN AMERICAN, MR. MOULTON, FOR I AM ONE OF THOSE WHO BELIEVE THAT THE FOLLY OF A MONARCH AND THE BLUNDERING OF A MINISTER IN FAR-GONE YEARS WILL NOT PREVENT OUR CHILDREN FROM BEING SOME DAY CITIZENS OF THE SAME WORLD-WIDE COUNTRY UNDER A FLAG WHICH SHALL BE A QUARTERING OF THE UNION JACK WITH THE STARS AND STRIPES.\"\n",
      "A FEW MOMENTS LATER HE WAS IN OUR ROOM, STILL PUFFING, STILL GESTICULATING, BUT WITH SO FIXED A LOOK OF GRIEF AND DESPAIR IN HIS EYES THAT OUR SMILES WERE TURNED IN AN INSTANT TO HORROR AND PITY. FOR A WHILE HE COULD NOT GET HIS WORDS OUT, BUT SWAYED HIS BODY AND PLUCKED AT HIS HAIR LIKE ONE WHO HAS BEEN DRIVEN TO THE EXTREME LIMITS OF HIS REASON. THEN, SUDDENLY SPRINGING TO HIS FEET, HE BEAT HIS HEAD AGAINST THE WALL WITH SUCH FORCE THAT WE BOTH RUSHED UPON HIM AND TORE HIM AWAY TO THE CENTRE OF THE ROOM. SHERLOCK HOLMES PUSHED HIM DOWN INTO THE EASY-CHAIR AND, SITTING BESIDE HIM, PATTED HIS HAND AND CHATTED WITH HIM IN THE EASY, SOOTHING TONES WHICH HE KNEW SO WELL HOW TO EMPLOY.\n",
      "SHERLOCK HOLMES SAT SILENT FOR SOME FEW MINUTES, WITH HIS BROWS KNITTED AND HIS EYES FIXED UPON THE FIRE.\n",
      "SHERLOCK HOLMES TOOK IT UP AND OPENED THE BUREAU.\n",
      "\"THERE IS ONE OTHER THING YOU OWE, MR. HOLDER,\" SAID SHERLOCK HOLMES RATHER STERNLY.\n",
      "\"TO THE MAN WHO LOVES ART FOR ITS OWN SAKE,\" REMARKED SHERLOCK HOLMES, TOSSING ASIDE THE ADVERTISEMENT SHEET OF THE DAILY TELEGRAPH, \"IT IS FREQUENTLY IN ITS LEAST IMPORTANT AND LOWLIEST MANIFESTATIONS THAT THE KEENEST PLEASURE IS TO BE DERIVED. IT IS PLEASANT TO ME TO OBSERVE, WATSON, THAT YOU HAVE SO FAR GRASPED THIS TRUTH THAT IN THESE LITTLE RECORDS OF OUR CASES WHICH YOU HAVE BEEN GOOD ENOUGH TO DRAW UP, AND, I AM BOUND TO SAY, OCCASIONALLY TO EMBELLISH, YOU HAVE GIVEN PROMINENCE NOT SO MUCH TO THE MANY CAUSES CELEBRES AND SENSATIONAL TRIALS IN WHICH I HAVE FIGURED BUT RATHER TO THOSE INCIDENTS WHICH MAY HAVE BEEN TRIVIAL IN THEMSELVES, BUT WHICH HAVE GIVEN ROOM FOR THOSE FACULTIES OF DEDUCTION AND OF LOGICAL SYNTHESIS WHICH I HAVE MADE MY SPECIAL PROVINCE.\"\n",
      "IT WAS A COLD MORNING OF THE EARLY SPRING, AND WE SAT AFTER BREAKFAST ON EITHER SIDE OF A CHEERY FIRE IN THE OLD ROOM AT BAKER STREET. A THICK FOG ROLLED DOWN BETWEEN THE LINES OF DUN-COLOURED HOUSES, AND THE OPPOSING WINDOWS LOOMED LIKE DARK, SHAPELESS BLURS THROUGH THE HEAVY YELLOW WREATHS. OUR GAS WAS LIT AND SHONE ON THE WHITE CLOTH AND GLIMMER OF CHINA AND METAL, FOR THE TABLE HAD NOT BEEN CLEARED YET. SHERLOCK HOLMES HAD BEEN SILENT ALL THE MORNING, DIPPING CONTINUOUSLY INTO THE ADVERTISEMENT COLUMNS OF A SUCCESSION OF PAPERS UNTIL AT LAST, HAVING APPARENTLY GIVEN UP HIS SEARCH, HE HAD EMERGED IN NO VERY SWEET TEMPER TO LECTURE ME UPON MY LITERARY SHORTCOMINGS.\n",
      "THE WORDS WERE HARDLY OUT OF HIS MOUTH BEFORE A MAN APPEARED AT THE DOOR OF THE ROOM, A VERY FAT AND BURLY MAN, WITH A HEAVY STICK IN HIS HAND. MISS HUNTER SCREAMED AND SHRUNK AGAINST THE WALL AT THE SIGHT OF HIM, BUT SHERLOCK HOLMES SPRANG FORWARD AND CONFRONTED HIM.\n",
